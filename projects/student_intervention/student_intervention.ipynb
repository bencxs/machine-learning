    "Reference: Gene Selection for Cancer Classification using Support Vector Machines, 2002, GUYON et al http://ace.cs.ohiou.edu/~razvan/courses/ml6830/papers/guyon-ml02.pdf\n",
    "\n",
    "Strengths:\n",
    "SVM is good for modelling complex and non-linear domains. For example, the student's graduation is modelled on internal factors (student's grades, age, gender, study time, etc) and external factors (who is the guardian, guardian's job, type of school, etc). Where, the underlying interrelationships between these factors are often complex (not a simple \"If X increases, Y decreases proportionally\" model). Also, SVM performs well on data which has a clear margin of separation, where the classes do not overlap. \n",
    "\n",
    "Weaknesses:\n",
    "SVM becomes computationally expensive if the data set is large (> 100k samples). Hence, training and predicting speeds will be slow on large datasets. SVM does not work well on skewed classes, where one class is many times greater in porportion to the other class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Reasoning for pick:\n",
    "Given that the data is a binary classification problem, SVM would work well. Also, SVM will perform well on the complex nature of modelling student's graduation (interrelationship among internal and external factors). The dataset is also not too heavily skewed, where about 67% of the students passed. \n",

    "\n",
    "Strengths:\n",
    "k-NN is fast to train, as it is instance-based. It only consults the data closests to the query point, considered as a 'lazy' learner. As a result, we do not need to train the model on the full dataset at a time and new data points can easily be added to the dataset without any need to retrain the model. k-NN is simple and straightforward to implement. \n",
    "\n",
    "Weaknesses:\n",
    "The output of k-NN on it's prediction will vary widely on the parameters specified, especially k, the number of nearest neighbors for the model to consider. Thus, the selection of the parameters will need to depend on the particular dataset to determine the appropriate domain knowledge to be used. k-NN can also be slow on large datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "Reasoning for pick:\n",
    "Although the predicting speed of k-NN might be slow, in the case of predicting the student failures, it is not imperative to be able to produce the predictions quickly (say, in milliseconds), as the speed is not a critical consideration in this application. Also, it is a simple model to implement and tune.\n",

    "\n",
    "Strengths: \n",
    "Random Forest performs well on modelling datasets for classification and generally has higher accuracy than other models since it is an ensemble method of algorithm. It can handle noise data fairly well as well as noise variables as along as the noise-to-signal ratio is not too high. Random Forest can aid in feature selection, outputting which features contribute most to the prediction results.\n",

    "Choosing an appropriate model as the best model is often a tradeoff between performance and other factors. Performance-wise, Random Forest is the best, once we get to utilize 300 training examples. However, based on the amount of available data, if we are only expecting very small amounts of data to work with, Random Forest may not be a good candidate, as it performs poorly in these conditions. In smaller datasets, SVM may be a better choice. If we are expecting a large dataset to work with (> 100k samples), care must be taken that models such as the SVM will generally perform slower as it gets computationally costly to train and test the model. In terms of training and predicting times, both Random Forest and SVM are generally slower, compared to k-NN, but for this particular problem, we are more interested in getting more correct predictions than faster models. In summary, once we consider all factors, the model with the highest prediction power (Random Forest) outweighs the cons of slower testing and training times. "

    "First, we feed Random Forest a dataset of students of the various features (age, gender, school type, etc) alongside the labels 'passed' and 'failed' for each student. The model works in principle, to build many smaller models called Trees which is then combined into one big model of a 'Forest' of Trees. Each Tree asks questions pertaining on the dataset, such as \"Is student age > 15?\" and \"Does student use the Internet?\". The goal for each Tree is to separate the students based on asking such questions. Each small Tree model may not be very powerful in predicting the student's outcomes, but the prediction power increases greatly with the resulting Random Forest model. In other words, Random Forest leverages on the power of many. The model first takes a random sample from the training data and then takes a random set of features to be trained on, and grows a tree based on that selection. It repeats by selecting another random training data sample and feature sample and grows more trees, until the model sufficiently fits the overall dataset. Then the results of all trees is averaged or voted to make the final result. When it comes to predicting the graduation of new students, the Tree questions of the Random Forest model that was previously created and trained is now used to categorize the new data. \n",

    "Let's say that the students who passed are represented by blue dots, and the students who fail by red dots. Each dot represents a student, and we gather all of these dots onto a flat soccer field. Now, we want to separate them as best as possible, using a straight line of a ruler. From our top-down view, we could see that we can visually separate these students fairly easily with a line, but there is one problem; there are muliple ways to align the ruler to sepaprate them. \n",

We start by reasoning \"Well, the best line can be thought of as the line that clearly separates between blue and red dots, and in such a way that the dots are as far as possible from the line we choose. This gives us most confidence that the line is indeed able to distinguish the two types of dots. We the place two more rulers on the line, and we push each ruler away from the middle line, up until one ruler hits one of the red dots and the other ruler hits one of the blue dots, forming a 'street' along these groups of dots. We adjusted the 'street' until we get the widest possible straight 'street' we can. Those few dots which touches the street boundaries are called 'supports' to our model, as they are key in determining the street margins.\n",

    "Now all is good, but it turns out there is a late comer to the field, so one student came running in and stood at a spot. Unfortunately, where the student stood caused a problem; our current 'street' is not separating all reds from blues anymore. No matter how much we try adjusting the straight line, there always seems to have a few blue dots in the red territory and red dots in the blue territory. Now we cant bend the ruler in this world, as it will break into pieces, but what we can do is bring out our secret gadget that turns our soccer field into a 3D cube-like field, where the students are suspended in various positions in mid-air. We can't use our rulers here, as it is meant for the 2D world, but we have a sheet of metal, which we use to slice through the 3D space so that all red and blue dots are now again separated. We are satisfied with what we've managed to do, and turned off the gadget so that the field returns to a flat piece again. Now, when we look at the outcome, we see that the sheet of metal has transformed into a curvy line that snaked through the groups of dots, and so we've managed to separate blues and reds again! Our 'street' is now curved!\n",

This time, we dont know if they are blue or red, because their teacher refused to tell us. We decided to employ our decision lines we drew previously and use that to group the students. We asked the students to scatter on the field and then we asked each one a few questions. We want to find the few students who would most likely exhibit similar characteristics of our 'support' students. We found a few matches, and marked them. Using them as bearings, we take our earlier 'street' model and place it where the new 'support' dots matched up as closely as our old ones previously. We decide that dots who are at one side of the street are red and the other side, blue, predicting the results based on what we've learnt previously."

One of the reasons is by using GridSearchCV implementation, we are using k-fold cross validation of k=3 by default. Whereas in the untuned model, we utilised the train_test_split defined by the size of training and testing splits. This means, a cross validated k-fold will typically produce lower F1 scores, as it is validated over multiple folds vs a single fold in the untuned model. In real-world applications, k-fold might reflect a better performance score compared to non k-fold."
