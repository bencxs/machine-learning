    "Reference: Gene Selection for Cancer Classification using Support Vector Machines, 2002, GUYON et al http://ace.cs.ohiou.edu/~razvan/courses/ml6830/papers/guyon-ml02.pdf\n",
    "\n",
    "Strengths:\n",
    "SVM is good for modelling complex and non-linear domains. For example, the student's graduation is modelled on internal factors (student's grades, age, gender, study time, etc) and external factors (who is the guardian, guardian's job, type of school, etc). Where, the underlying interrelationships between these factors are often complex (not a simple \"If X increases, Y decreases proportionally\" model). Also, SVM performs well on data which has a clear margin of separation, where the classes do not overlap. \n",
    "\n",
    "Weaknesses:\n",
    "SVM becomes computationally expensive if the data set is large (> 100k samples). Hence, training and predicting speeds will be slow on large datasets. SVM does not work well on skewed classes, where one class is many times greater in porportion to the other class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Reasoning for pick:\n",
    "Given that the data is a binary classification problem, SVM would work well. Also, SVM will perform well on the complex nature of modelling student's graduation (interrelationship among internal and external factors). The dataset is also not too heavily skewed, where about 67% of the students passed. \n",

    "\n",
    "Strengths:\n",
    "k-NN is fast to train, as it is instance-based. It only consults the data closests to the query point, considered as a 'lazy' learner. As a result, we do not need to train the model on the full dataset at a time and new data points can easily be added to the dataset without any need to retrain the model. k-NN is simple and straightforward to implement. \n",
    "\n",
    "Weaknesses:\n",
    "The output of k-NN on it's prediction will vary widely on the parameters specified, especially k, the number of nearest neighbors for the model to consider. Thus, the selection of the parameters will need to depend on the particular dataset to determine the appropriate domain knowledge to be used. k-NN can also be slow on large datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "Reasoning for pick:\n",
    "Although the predicting speed of k-NN might be slow, in the case of predicting the student failures, it is not imperative to be able to produce the predictions quickly (say, in milliseconds), as the speed is not a critical consideration in this application. Also, it is a simple model to implement and tune.\n",

    "\n",
    "Strengths: \n",
    "Random Forest performs well on modelling datasets for classification and generally has higher accuracy than other models since it is an ensemble method of algorithm. It can handle noise data fairly well as well as noise variables as along as the noise-to-signal ratio is not too high. Random Forest can aid in feature selection, outputting which features contribute most to the prediction results.\n",

    "The best model is the SVM. One reason is that the model outperforms the other two (On average an F1 Score of 0.78 vs 0.73) in terms of performance. Thus, if the desired outcome is for more correct classifications, then SVM is the best model. Another point to note is the training times of the models. On average, the SVM model trains at 0.0757 seconds (Random Forest 0.0563 seconds, and k-NN at 0.002 seconds). This makes SVM the slowest among the 3 algorithms, but in real-life applications, taking a fraction of a second to train a model is considered fast, and hence, cost is not much of an impact (time cost and computational cost). As for the prediction times, SVM clocks in at 0.0067 (Random Forest 0.001 seconds, k-NN 0.0157). This is the second fastest model, but for purposes of predicting a student's tendency to pass or fail, we do not require an extremely fast prediction time, as having very quick results do not provide any additional benefit to our decision making process. Although Random Forest seems to provide overall great results and performance in all metrics, care must be taken as the F1 Score for Training is very high (near 1.0) and yet the F1 Score for Testing is much lower in comparison (0.73). This is due to high variance (that the model is overfitting to the train data and hence cannot generalize well on test data). If we have limited data to train on, then the model would not be good at generalizing unseen data. In summary, considering all factors, the benefit of choosing the best performing model (SVM) outweighs the cons of slower training and testing times.\n"

    "The Support Vector Machines model is one method capable of classifying our dataset. In this case, we want to classify students who pass to those who fail, based on various factors we have recorded in our dataset, such as age, type of school, occupation of guardian, etc. To do this, we label each data entry (corresponsing to each student) of a particular combination of these factors that whether this student has passed or failed. Once we've done labelling all the data rows, we train the model by tellling it that these are the students who passed and failed and the model will find methods to distinct each student group, so that students who passed are clearly separated from those who failed. It does this by finding a boundary line that separates between students who passed vs students who failed. This boundary line width is also maximized, so that we get the best possible boundary line that clearly makes the separation distinct and hence make it easier for us to make a decision confidently whether a student falls into one category or another. When predicting, the model takes in a new set of data, where we do not have any labels of pass/fail, and the model will categorize this student into the appropriate group based on the decision boundary that was created on the labelled dataset it was trained on."

    "The final models F1 Score for Training and Testing are 0.8546 and 0.7820 respectively. As noticed, these scores are lower than the untuned model. There could be a few reasons due to this. One of the reasons is by using GridSearchCV implementation, we are using k-fold cross validation of k=3 by default. Whereas in the untuned model, we utilised the train_test_split defined by the size of training and testing splits. This means, a cross validated k-fold will typically produce lower F1 scores, as it is validated over multiple folds vs a single fold in the untuned model. In real-world applications, k-fold might reflect a better performance score compared to non k-fold."
